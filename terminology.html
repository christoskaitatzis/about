							<h4>Kotlin operators</h4>
							<p>Description and examples of higher-order functions (operators):
							<br>
							1. **Filter Operator (`filter`)**:
							   - Use: To extract elements from a collection that satisfy a given condition.
							   - Example: Filtering out even numbers from a list.
							
							   ```kotlin
							   val numbers = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)

							   // Output: evenNumbers = [2, 4, 6]
							   ```
							<br>
							2. **Map Operator (`map`)**:
							   - Use: To transform each element of a collection into a new form.
							   - Example: Converting a list of names to their corresponding lengths.
							
							   ```kotlin
