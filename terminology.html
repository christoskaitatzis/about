							<h4>Basics</h4>
							<p><b>IDE - Integrated Development Environment:</b> A software tool that facilitates coding, debugging, and testing. It typically includes a code editor, compiler, and debugger.</p>
							    <p><b>API - Application Programming Interface:</b> A set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate and interact with each other.</p>
							    <p><b>SDK - Software Development Kit:</b> A collection of tools, libraries, and documentation that simplifies and accelerates the development of applications for a specific platform.</p>
							    <p><b>UI - User Interface:</b> The visual elements and layout that users interact with in an application to perform tasks and access information.</p>
							    <p><b>UX - User Experience:</b> Refers to the overall experience a user has while interacting with an application, including usability, accessibility, and satisfaction.</p>
							    <p><b>JSON - JavaScript Object Notation:</b> A lightweight data interchange format used to transmit data between a server and a client as text.</p>
							    <p><b>XML - Extensible Markup Language:</b> A markup language used to define and transport data in a human-readable format.</p>
							    <p><b>HTTP - Hypertext Transfer Protocol:</b> The foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web, enabling the exchange of web pages and resources between servers and clients.</p>
							    <p><b>MVC - Model-View-Controller:</b> An architectural pattern used to separate an application into three interconnected components: Model (data), View (user interface), and Controller (logic).</p>
							    <p><b>OOP - Object-Oriented Programming:</b> A programming paradigm that organizes code into reusable objects, promoting modularity and flexibility.</p>
							<h4>Advanced</h4>
							<p><b>ORM - Object-Relational Mapping:</b> A technique that allows developers to interact with a database using object-oriented concepts instead of raw SQL queries.</p>
							    <p><b>REST - Representational State Transfer:</b> An architectural style for designing networked applications, using standard HTTP methods for data manipulation.</p>
							    <p><b>SQLite - Lightweight Embedded Database:</b> A self-contained, serverless database engine widely used in mobile applications for local data storage.</p>
							    <p><b>Dagger - Dependency Injection Framework:</b> A library for simplifying dependency injection in Android applications, aiding in modular and testable code.</p>
							    <p><b>Gradle - Build Automation Tool:</b> A build system commonly used in Android development to automate building, testing, and packaging of the app.</p>
							    <p><b>Flutter - Cross-platform UI Framework:</b> A framework by Google for building native mobile applications on both Android and iOS using a single codebase.</p>
							    <p><b>RxJava - Reactive Extensions for Java:</b> A library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs using observable sequences.</p>
							    <p><b>Retrofit - HTTP Client Library:</b> A type-safe HTTP client library for Android and Java that simplifies communication with web services.</p>
							    <p><b>Push Notification - Real-time Message Delivery:</b> Messages sent from a server to a user's device, alerting them of new information or events even when the app is not active.</p>
							    <p><b>Core Data - Data Persistence Framework (iOS):</b> A framework used in iOS development to manage the model layer of an application and handle data storage.</p>
							<p><b>Dagger Hilt - Dependency Injection Library (Android):</b> An extension of Dagger that simplifies dependency injection in Android apps, providing improved compile-time checks and reduced boilerplate code.</p>
							    <p><b>GraphQL - Query Language for APIs:</b> A query language and runtime for APIs that enables clients to request specific data from the server, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching.</p>
							    <p><b>CI/CD Automation - Pipeline Configuration:</b> Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment configuration that automates the build, testing, and deployment processes, ensuring a smooth development cycle.</p>
							    <p><b>Proguard/R8 - Code Obfuscation and Shrinking (Android):</b> Tools used to optimize and shrink Android application code, making it more secure and smaller in size.</p>
							    <p><b>Firebase Analytics - App Usage Tracking:</b> A service by Google that provides insights into user engagement and behavior within an application.</p>
							    <p><b>NDK - Native Development Kit:</b> A set of tools used to integrate native code (C/C++) into Android applications, when necessary for performance or access to platform-specific features.</p>
							    <p><b>MVVM - Model-View-ViewModel:</b> An architectural pattern that enhances the separation of concerns in an application, improving testability and maintainability.</p>
							    <p><b>Reactive Programming - RxSwift, RxCocoa (iOS):</b> The application of reactive extensions in Swift and Cocoa frameworks to handle asynchronous data streams and events.</p>
							    <p><b>Security Best Practices - Encryption, SSL Pinning:</b> Techniques and protocols to safeguard data and communication, protecting users' privacy and preventing security breaches.</p>
							    <p><b>Accessibility - Making Apps Inclusive:</b> Ensuring apps are usable by people with disabilities, incorporating features like VoiceOver (iOS) and TalkBack (Android).</p>
